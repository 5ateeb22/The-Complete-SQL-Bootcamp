--Create a table to organize our potential leads! We will have the following information:

--A customer's first name, last name,email,sign-up date, and number of minutes spent on the dvd rental site. 
--You should also have some sort of id tracker for them. You have free reign on how you want to create this table, 
--the next lecture will show one possible implementation of this.

--Have fun and feel free to ask any discussion questions if you're confused! 
--Remember, we're just focused on the basics of creating a table right now!

CREATE TABLE customer_info(

    customer_email VARCHAR (255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    customer_minutes_on_site INTEGER NOT NULL,
