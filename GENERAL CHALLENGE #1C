--How many unique districts are our customers from?

     -- First attempt

SELECT DISTINCT district COUNT
FROM address;

     -- Final attempt

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT(district)) --SELECTing the COUNT of each DISTINCT district
FROM address 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Retrieve the list of names for those distinct districts from the previous question

SELECT DISTINCT(district) --removing COUNT from the query
FROM address;
